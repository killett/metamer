# Phase 2b — the (a)–(k) pre-flight, per task

The audit run against each Phase 2b task brief **before** any code is written, and what each
finding changed. Same role as
[`phase2a-preflight.md`](phase2a-preflight.md) played for 2a and
[`phase2-preliminaries-preflight.md`](phase2-preliminaries-preflight.md) for P0–P4.

The method is [`phase1-to-phase2-handoff.md`](phase1-to-phase2-handoff.md) §1. Only the
findings live here; the reasoning behind the decisions being audited is in `PROGRESS.md`'s
2b brainstorm section and in the plan itself.

**Append to this file before each task, not after.** An audit written afterwards is a report
on work already done, and the whole point is that it changes the work.

## Pre-plan audit (run 2026-08-14, against the inherited brief)

The audit that produced the plan rather than any single task's. Its subject was
`PROGRESS.md`'s *WHAT SUB-PHASE 2b INHERITS*, design doc §9.4 / §11.1 / §11.4, and the live
code. **Four findings, F1–F4**, stated in full at the head of
[`../plans/2026-08-14-metamer-phase2b.md`](../plans/2026-08-14-metamer-phase2b.md) and
summarized in `PROGRESS.md`'s 2b brainstorm section. In one line each:

- **F1** — nothing maps the budget to `block_bytes`; exit criterion 7 is unsatisfiable at
  scale as a result. (a2) at an arithmetic boundary: a name used as though it were a gate.
- **F2** — `memory.bytes_per_series` describes the batched trust-region deleted at Task 19,
  and the measurement that validated it drove a batched evaluation. **Promoted as (j2)** and,
  with F4, as **(a6)**.
- **F3** — the output-slot term omits four things `fit` holds. With F2 it is (a) inside a sum:
  **two errors of opposite sign, invisible to any check on the total.**
- **F4** — `Backend` names two architectures and production has neither. **Promoted as (a6).**

Five pre-flight lines were promoted out of this audit and the brainstorm that followed it:
**(a6)**, **(j2)**, **(j3)**, the two-sided restatement of the standing memory check, and the
separate-commits attribution rule. All five live in the handoff, not here.

## Task 0 — the memory formula corrected

*Not yet audited. The audit is the first step of the task.*
